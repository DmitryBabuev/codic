This application will help you to manage input devices and conrol charge level as easy as posible!

1. Firstly, you need to run "setup" to install some necessary packeges
2. On this step you can run ADVC-helper already(./bin/main.py)! (following is currently unenabled) But if you want to add this fantastic app to your local applications and launch it on startup you should perform several motion:
    (After runnig "setup"!)
     - ....-helper-startup.desktop should be placed in   ~/.config/autostart
     - ....-helper.desktop should be placed in           ~/.local/share/applications

Now you can find ADVC-helper application in Linux menu or still run "./bin/main.py"

---------USAGE-----------
On the main screen you can see a list of input devices. Every device can be switched to able/disable mode by turning the switch. Also, you can use shourcuts CTRL+ALT+[0-9], where nums are the numbers of devices in device list.

Below you can see the percentage of charge level and availability of AC power source.

On setting tab you can manage warning and critical charge levels. After riching warning level notifications will be sent. After riching critical level your laptop will be sent in suspend mode.

Have a nice usage!
